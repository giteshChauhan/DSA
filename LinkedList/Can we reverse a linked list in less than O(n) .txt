    It doesnâ€™t look possible to reverse a simple singly linked list in less than O(n).
    A simple singly linked list can only be reversed in O(n) time using recursive and 
    iterative methods. 

    A memory-efficient doubly  linked  list with  head and tail  pointers can also be 
    reverse in O(1) time by swapping head and tail pointers.

    A doubly linked list with head and tail pointers can also be reversed in O(1) time
    by  swapping head and  tail  pointers, but we  would have to  traverse the list in 
    forward direction using prev pointer and reverse direction using next pointer which
    may not be considered valid.
